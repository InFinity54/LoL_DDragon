No matter how close the authorities came to catching him, the rogue always found a way to slip through their fingers.  Despite his good fortune, he was never able to win that which he truly desired - the ability to control magic.  When Twisted Fate learned of an experiment being conducted in Zaun that might help him with his wish, he did the only thing a gambler of his worth could do - he went all in and volunteered for the experiment.ЪщЩшШчЧцЦфФпПлЛйЙиИзЗжЖдДгГбБяЯюЮъЪщЩшШчЧцЦфФпПлЛйЙиИзЗжЖдДгГбБ<br><br>БбГгДдЖжЗзИиЙйЛлПпФфЦцЧчШшЩщЪъЮюЯяБбГгДдЖжЗзИиЙйЛлПпФфЦцЧчШшЩщЪъЮюЯяБбГгДдЖжЗзИиЙйЛлПпФфЦцЧчШшЩщConducted by the infamous Dr. Xavier Rath, Twisted Fate was told that the wager for such participation might be steep.  He might change forever, or nothing might happen, or he might die horribly.  Pain, however, was likely a part of the deal no matter the outcome. These were hardly the worst odds the gambler had faced; his hopes raised, Twisted Fate underwent the experiment, enduring what he must for a chance at his dream.  Then, it ended - with seemingly no effect whatsoever.  The gypsy rogue flew into a murderous rage, but, before he could strike down the team, he suddenly teleported himself miles away.  With a sly grin, he realized his luck had won out yet again. He now brings his luck and rakish charm to the Institute of War, where he is the Champion of choice for many - especially the gambling kind.  To this day, Twisted Fate has avoided his inevitable reunion with Dr. Rath.  The Card Master knows, however, that a confrontation is coming.ЩшШчЧцЦфФпПлЛйЙиИзЗжЖдДгГбБяЯюЮъЪщЩшШчЧцЦфФпПлЛйЙиИзЗжЖдДгГбБяЯюЮъЪщЩшШчЧцЦфФпПлЛйЙиИзЗжЖдДгГбБ<br><br>БбГгДдЖжЗзИиWhile the future may be mysterious and unknown to most, Twisted Fate is certain that his future lies within the cards.иИзЗжЖдДгГбБ","blurb":"БбГгДдЖжЗзИиЙйЛлПпФфЦцЧчШшЩщЪъЮюЯяБбГгДдЖжЗзИиЙйЛлПпФфЦцЧчШшЩщЪъAlthough born to poor gypsy parents, the champion known as Twisted Fate was able to gamble his way to prosperity as a card shark in the seedy underground gambling circuits of Demacia and ...","allytips":["БбГгДдЖжCoordinate with your allies for the best time to use Destiny to ambush enemies.жЖдДгГбБ","БбГгДдЖжЗзИиЙйЛStealth characters often escape a battle with very low hit points.
