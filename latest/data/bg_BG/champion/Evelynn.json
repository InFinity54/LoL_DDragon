What everyone does know about Evelynn, however, is that she is one of the most skilled assassins in Valoran.  It is clear upon first meeting her that she is not quite human.  Some theorize that she was cursed with a mild form of fantastical vampirism as a child.  Supporters of this theory contend that her ability to sap the very life essence of her opponents on (and off) the Fields of Justice, while still being able to tolerate direct sunlight, would account for this belief.  There is some evidence that Evelynn originally came from the Shadow Isles - the mysterious island located northwest of Valoran that is eternally blanketed by a thick, unnatural fog.  It is thought that the Shadow Isles are home to countless forms of undead, though no one seems eager to perform the exploration necessary to find out the truth.  Evelynn neither confirms nor denies her connection to Shadow Isles.<br><br>The power brokers of Valoran know that Evelynn's services come at the highest of premiums, and her recent addition to the League of Legends indicates that her ambitions are growing.  Her savagery on the Fields of Justice has been so great that new rumors about her origins are now circulating.  The most popular one - an abuse of magic as a child morphed her into the hungering beast her opponents see on the battlefield - always makes her smile when hearing it... an act that bares her razor-sharp fangs and teeth.  Evelynn now curries favor from League summoners, gaining influence for reasons known only to her.  While the nature of her plans- much like almost everything else about her - remains unknown, there's little doubt that those plans are now set on the world stage. <br><br>''There is little mystery about her to me - she is the ultimate predator.''<br>-- Jax","blurb":"Evelynn's origins are shrouded in mystery - a mystery she herself helps to perpetuate.
