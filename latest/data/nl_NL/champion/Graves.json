He survived a childhood in the pirate-run slums using every dirty trick in the book.  Intent on building a new life for himself, he stowed away on the first ship to the mainland he could sneak aboard.  However, the grim realities of the world forced him to eke out an unsavory living in the underground of various city-states, jumping the border whenever things got too hot.  At a particularly high-stakes game of cards, he found himself seated opposite Twisted Fate.  They both flipped four aces on the final hand.  It was the first time either conman had met his equal.  The two formed an alliance, swindling marks at the tables and scrapping back-to-back in the alleys afterward.  Together, they ran the streets â€“ stacking chips, decks, and charges.øºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøº<br><br>ºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøUnfortunately Graves made the mistake of hustling a hefty sum from Dr. Aregor Priggs, a high-ranking Zaunite official and businessman.  When Priggs discovered how he'd been played, he became obsessed with revenge.  He learned about Twisted Fate's all-consuming desire to control magic and he promptly offered him a trade: serve Graves up in exchange for enrollment in a procedure which would grant his wish.  Twisted Fate took the deal â€“ both he and Graves knew the stakes of their arrangement, but the offer was too good.  Once acquired, Priggs had Graves taken to a special location built to hold men whose crimes â€“ or more precisely their punishments â€“ were meant to stay off the books.  Graves endured years of captivity at the hands of Zaun's most unscrupulous wardens before he managed to escape.  One of his fellow detainees introduced him to an eccentric gunsmith who modified a shotgun exactly to his specifications.  After he paid a visit to Priggs, Graves joined the League of Legends with two targets in his sights:  Twisted Fate and payback.øºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøº<br><br>ºøºøºøº''They got a saying in the locker: ain't got nothin' but time to plan.''ºøºøºøº<br>-Gravesº","blurb":"ºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøºøMalcolm Graves was born in the back of a Bilgewater tavern and left there with a bottle of spiked milk.
