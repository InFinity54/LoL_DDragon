By the time he'd completed his third doctorate, he had already become the greatest of all yordle scientists and there was little his home could still offer him.  The great academies of Piltover far to the north called to him, daring him to make his mark in the City of Progress.  Knowing he would never thrive away from his own kind, Heimerdinger gathered like-minded yordles to join him in his quest, thus forming the backbone of the now famous Yordle Academy of Science & Progress.  Since then, he has become one of the most respected minds of the modern age and his academy is one of the leading institutions in all of Valoran.<br><br>Heimerdinger has pioneered many new scientific achievements, delving deeper and deeper into the field of techmaturgy, including the development of the now ubiquitous star-rods that light many of the streets of the city-states.  However, there is something strange about the Revered Inventor.  In his quest to expand knowledge, he underwent an experiment of his own design to allow him to use a greater portion of his brain simultaneously.  It most certainly worked, but at an unusual cost - Heimerdinger's brain increased in size.  His head changed along with it and now the great scientist looks like a yordle with a giant brain-shaped head.  Heimerdinger has turned his attentions to the current state of war on Valoran, however, and works to rectify what he considers is an unacceptable situation.  Heimerdinger believes that science is the key to saving the world.  Much more, he has rolled up his sleeves and is out to prove this as a member of the League of Legends - most definitely as the League's smartest champion!<br><br>Science is on the march.  Look out!","blurb":"It is unusual to see yordles outside of Bandle City, but the lure of science was something Heimerdinger could not resist.
