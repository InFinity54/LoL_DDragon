# _League of Legends_ - Data Dragon

Do you want to use DDragon for _Teamfight Tactics_? [Check the _Teamfight Tactics_ repository here](https://github.com/InFinity54/TFT_DDragon).

## Introduction
_Data Dragon_ is a package of files you can use for your projects about [_League of Legends_](https://www.leagueoflegends.com), distributed by Riot Games. A new version of Data Dragon is released some days after each game update. This repository allows you to update automatically all files more easily.

Don't forget that new patchs will be added right after their release on Riot Games' Developers website, but it takes often many days to come.

## Additional contents in this repository
This repository contains some additional files, not included in Data Dragon :

- Icons of all tiers with sublevels (I/II/III/IV) : Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, Grand Master, Challenger
- Icons of all lanes in the game, with some bonus : Top, Jungle, Mid, Bot, Support, Autofill, Unknown

- Some wallpapers used while in group or in queue in game client

²For the moment, Data about Summoner Spells is only available in `en_US`, but the file will be translated into others langages later. 

## Unused contents in this repository
Because of the presence of all previous patchs (which can still be downloaded from Riot Games servers), some contents which became unused in _League of Legends_ are available in this repository. This content can be some deleted elements, or old versions of actual stuff. In the repository, you will find :

- Old runes and masteries, deleted from the game since patch 7.22 (November 8th, 2017)
- Some items icons that was previously removed from the game
- Minimap from old games modes or previous temporary games modes
- Old items icons, before the remastering of in-game shop and the remastering of all items of the game of patch 10.23, for the preseason 11 (patch released on November 11th, 2020)

## Additional notes
- Some files (tiles, loading splashs and splashs of champions especially) can be incorrect. This problem has been notifed to Riot Games, and [they actually work on a fix](https://github.com/RiotGames/developer-relations/issues/348).
- There is some other problems in champions JSON, like Ornn's upgraded items which doesn't appear in this JSONs files. Riot has been notified for this problem too, and [they are investigating the problem](https://github.com/RiotGames/developer-relations/issues/419).
- Some champions, like Fiddlesticks, are missed spelled in JSON files, which can create some problems when trying to retrieve images from data in JSONs files. [A fix is on the way](https://github.com/RiotGames/developer-relations/issues/83).
- Others problems has been reported to Riot Games, and you can find all of them (and the 3 above too) in the [Riot Games' Developer Relations Bug Tracking about League of Legends' Data Dragon](https://github.com/RiotGames/developer-relations/labels/topic%3A%20ddrag%20lol).
