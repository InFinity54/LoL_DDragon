# _League of Legends_ - Data Dragon

Check the _Data Dragon_ repository for [_2XKO_](https://github.com/InFinity54/2XKO_DDragon), [_League of Runeterra_](https://github.com/InFinity54/LoR_DDragon), or [_Valorant_](https://github.com/InFinity54/Valorant_DDragon). _Teamfight Tactics_ data is now included in this repository.

## Introduction
_Data Dragon_ is a package of files you can use for your projects about [_League of Legends_](https://www.leagueoflegends.com), distributed by Riot Games. A new version of Data Dragon is released some days after each game update. This repository allows you to update automatically all files more easily.

Don't forget that new patchs will be added right after their release on Riot Games' Developers website, but it takes often many days to come.

Since patch 13.12.1 and set 9 release for _Teamfight Tactics_, this repository is also containing data from _Teamfight Tactics_.

## Unused contents in this repository
Because of the presence of all previous patchs (which can still be downloaded from Riot Games servers), some contents which became unused in _League of Legends_ are available in this repository. This content can be some deleted elements, or old versions of actual stuff. In the repository, you will find :

- Old runes and masteries, deleted from the game since patch 7.22 (November 8th, 2017)
- Some items icons that was previously removed from the game
- Minimap from old games modes or previous temporary games modes
- Old items icons, before the remastering of in-game shop and the remastering of all items of the game of patch 10.23, for the preseason 11 (patch released on November 11th, 2020)

## Additional notes
- Some champions, like Fiddlesticks, are missed spelled in JSON files, which can create some problems when trying to retrieve images from data in JSONs files. [A fix is on the way](https://github.com/RiotGames/developer-relations/issues/83).
- Others problems has been reported to Riot Games, and you can find all of them (and the 3 above too) in the [Riot Games' Developer Relations Bug Tracking about League of Legends' Data Dragon](https://github.com/RiotGames/developer-relations/labels/topic%3A%20ddrag%20lol).
- Starting patch 13.10.1, Vietnamese language code has been changed by Riot from `vn_VN` to `vi_VN`. The `vn_VN` files has been moved to the `vi_VN` folder, including unused data. This has been [announced by Riot on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RiotGamesDevRel/status/1658949539867271171).
