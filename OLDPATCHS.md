### Missing patchs
Some patchs wasn't added to this repository for various reasons :

- 13.2 : this patch was replaced by a hotfix (13.1B) after Riot's hack, and don't exist at all
- 13.1B : _Data Dragon_ never released by Riot Games for this patch
- 10.17 : _Data Dragon_ never released by Riot Games for this patch
- 5.11 : _Data Dragon_ never released by Riot Games for this patch

Some patchs wasn't released by Riot Games for the oldest versions of League of Legends, for all hotfixes releases for the game. This is the case, for example, for patchs 3.6.1 to 3.6.13. Some others (old) patchs were also handled that way by Riot.
